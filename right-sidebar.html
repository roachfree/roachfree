									<p>Roachfree is a product of a young mind - 17 years old Aryaman Taparia, who
										comprehended a two-fold problem related to cockroaches: <br />
										Firstly, he harboured an immense fear for roaches, finding it difficult to fall
										asleep if he knew there was one in his house.<br />
										Secondly, the toxic gas released from chemical repellents gave him an allergic
										reaction.
									</p>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/aryaman.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>There were some cockroaches in our apartment during COVID-19 period. Due to COVID restrictions we could not call home a pest control agency. 
										The cook/helper in our house suggested us to use a homemade formula to get rid of cockroaches which they were using in their hometown. 
										So as to avoid any COVID exposure we asked him to try for us and could not believe that it worked miraculously as all cockroaches in 
										our apartment were gone after applying it in a period of two days. The good thing about the formula was that it was odourless, 
										did not require spraying of any toxic chemicals which are harmful, did not require any cleaning of toxic chemicals and picking up of dead cockroaches as the 
										cockroaches just disappeared from our apartment. I was impressed how this simple formula could be so effective for getting rid of cockroaches. 
										A thought came to my mind that why not sell this to other households who would also be needing this to get rid of cockroaches, it being odourless, 
										not requiring any toxic chemicals, cleaning, picking up of dead cockroaches and being very effective. The formula was easy to make with all available home 
										ingredients like Gram Flour, Boric powder, milk, etc. I discussed with my father and he also like the idea and suggested to first give to our building people for 
										trials to confirm its efficacy. We gave it to our building people complimentary to try. We were pleasantly surprised to get feedback that it worked miraculously 
										and few of them also asked us to give more for their relatives. 
										I then started taking steps to start marketing of this product.
